sdesc: "32-bit image retouching tool"
ldesc: "CinePaint is a painting and retouching tool primarily used for 
motion picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting.

CinePaint is different from other painting tools because it supports
deep color depth image formats up to 32 bits per channel deep. For
comparison, GIMP is limited 8-bit, and Photoshop to 16-bit."
